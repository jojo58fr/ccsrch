This project is a fork of CCSRCH as maintained by Adam Caudill at: https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch - it is based on the last version released (1.0.9) which was released in Jan 2, 2017.

### Using CCSRCH-ADV

```
Usage: ./ccsrch <options> <start path>
  where <options> are:
    -a             Limit to ascii files.
    -b             Add the byte offset into the file of the number
    -e             Include the Modify Access and Create times in terms
                   of seconds since the epoch
    -f             Just output the filename with potential PAN data
    -i <filename>  Ignore credit card numbers in this list (test cards)
    -j             Include the Modify Access and Create times in terms
                   of normal date/time
    -o <filename>  Output the data to the file <filename> vs. standard out
    -t <1 or 2>    Check if the pattern follows either a Track 1
                   or 2 format
    -T             Check for both Track 1 and Track 2 patterns
    -c             Show a count of hits per file (only when using -o)
    -s             Show live status information (only when using -o)
    -l N           Limits the number of results from a single file before going
                   on to the next file.
    -n <list>      File extensions to exclude (i.e .dll,.exe)
    -m             Mask the PAN number.
    -w             Check for card matches wrapped across lines.
    -h             Usage information
    -x             Hide PAN values by XXXX********XXXX format (* is hidden)
	-X             Replace PAN values by censor it using asterisk (*) on source file
```

**Examples:**

Generic search for credit card data starting in current directory with output to screen:

`ccsrch ./`

Generic search for credit card data starting in c:\storage with output to mycard.log:

`ccsrch -o mycard.log c:\storage`

Search for credit card data and check for Track 2 data formats with output to screen:

`ccsrch -t 2 ./`

Search for credit card data and check for Track 2 data formats with output to file c.log:

`ccsrch -t 2 -o c.log ./`

Search for all track data types in ascii only files and ignore known test card numbers:

`ccsrch -T -i ignore.list -a ./`

Search for credit card data and hide pan in the source file for security issues (Data masking and desensitization (DM)).

`ccsrch â€“o mycard.log -x c:\storage`

### Output

All output is tab delimited with the following order (depending on the parameters):

* Source File
* Card Type
* Card Number
* Byte Offset
* Modify Time
* Access Time
* Create Time
* Track Pattern Match

### Assumptions

The following assumptions are made throughout the program searching for the 
card numbers:

1. Cards can be a minimum of 14 numbers and up to 16 numbers.
2. Card numbers must be contiguous. The only characters ignored when processing the files are dashes, carriage returns, new line feeds, and nulls.
3. Files are treated as raw binary objects and processed one character at a time.
4. Solo and Switch cards are not processed in the prefix search.
5. Compressed or encoded files are NOT uncompressed or decoded in this version. These files should be identified separately and the program run on the decompressed or decoded versions.

**Prefix Logic**  
The following prefixes are used to validate the potential card numbers that have passed the mod 10 (Luhn) algorithm check.

### Known Issues

One typical observation/complaint is the number of false positives that still come up.  You will need to manually review and remove these. Certain patterns will repeatedly come up which match all of the criteria for valid cards, but are clearly bogus. In addition, there are certain system files which clearly should not have cardholder data in them and can be ignored.  There may be an "ignore file list" in a new release to reduce the amount of stuff to go through, however this will impact the speed of the tool.

Note that since this program opens up each file and processes it, obviously the access time (in epoch seconds) will change.  If you are going to do forensics, one assumes that you have already collected an image following standard forensic practices and either have already collected and preserved the MAC times, or are using this tool on a copy of the image.

For the track data search feature, the tool just examines the preceding characters before the valid credit card number and either the delimiter, or the delimiter and the characters (e.g. expiration date) following the credit card number.

We have found that for some POS software log files are generated that not only wrap across multiple lines, but insert hex representations of the ASCII values of the PAN data as well. Furthermore, these log files may contain track data. Remember that the only way that ccsrch will find the PAN data and track data is if it is contiguous. In certain instances you may luck out because the log files will contain an entire contiguous PAN and will get flagged. We would encourage you to visually examine the files identified for confirmation. Introducing logic to capture all of the crazy possible storage representations of PAN and track data we've seen would make this tool a beast.

Please note that ccsrch recurses through the filesystem given a start directory and will attempt to open any file or object read-only one at a time. Given that this could be performance or load intensive depending on the existing load on the system or its configuration, we recommend that you run the tool on a subset or sample of directories first in order to get an idea of the potential impact. We disclaim all liability for any performance impact, outages, or problems ccsrch could cause.

### Porting

This tool has been successfully compiled and run on the following operating systems: FreeBSD, Linux, SCO 5.0.4-5.0.7, Solaris 8, AIX 4.1.X, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows 7.  If you have any issues getting it to run on any systems, please contact the author.
